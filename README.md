# Python
This is an extremely elementary and nooby Python program which makes a SOS emergency message in Morse code, using #winsound and #time built-in libraries. 
The Morse Code For S.O.S is:    ...  ---  ...   (3 dots for "S" amd 3 dashes for "O). Everybody should know it.
I'm learning and practicing python. so any advice, hint, rule of thumb, shortcut ,etc is greatly appreciated.
